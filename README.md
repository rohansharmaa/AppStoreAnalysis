# AppStoreAnalysis
This project is a practise project for data analysis. We are going to sort through a data set containing lists of apps and corresponding information and apply Pythin techniques to understand what kind of apps are likely to attract more users on the PlayStore.
We are making use of two datasets, one for the Apple Playstore and one for the Google Playstore.
